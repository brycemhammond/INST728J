                <p>Hey! My name is Bryce Hammond. I am a graduate student at The University of Maryland, College Park studying Human-Computer Interaction. </p>

                <h1 style="text-align: center;">More About Me</h1>
                <h2>What motivated this project?</h2>
                <p>I was trying to think of problems and pain points I had during my first year of graduate school. I decided the biggest pain point was remembering everything
                    I needed to do. Between my responsibilities as a Graduate Assistant, as a Software Engineer Intern for a defense company, and as a full time student who was 
                    pursuing internship opportunities, I always found myself struggling to remember what I had to do and when things were due...which led to quite a few
                    close calls with deadlines. I thought it would be cool to create a to-do list that breaks down tasks into categories. I have experience with front end 
                    development, but I wanted to practice my JS skills a bit more, especially with content routing and JS animation. 
                </p>
                <h2>Why'd you choose to pursue a M.S. in Human-Computer Interaction?</h2>
                <p>I graduated in May 2019 with my B.S. Information Science. I have always loved tech, specifically software development, and growing up,
                I was always drawing and painting. When I took INST362 in undergrad, I fell in love with the idea of Human-Computer Interaction. I did some AdobeXD
                tutorials and decided to apply to the HCI program to strengthen my design skills. It's a good way for me to mesh my passions for tech and art without 
                compromising one or the other.
                </p>
                <h2>What technologies are used for this web application?</h2>
                <p>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                <h2>What do you want to do after you graduate?</h2>
                <p>Honestly, the answer to this question changes almost weekly. From a career standpoint, I can see myself starting out as a Software Engineer 
                on a product team for a small to midsize company. From a personal standpoint, I would love to travel if it is safe to do so. I love travelling and it's been
                hard not being able to travel because of the pandemic.
