My name is Bryce Hammond. I am a HCI graduate student at The University of Maryland. I was born and raised in the DMV area. While I enjoy designing and coding, in my free time, I also enjoy working out, drawing and painting, listening to music, cooking, and spending time with friends. I consider myself a foodie and some of my favorite foods include Margarita Grilled Chicken, Shrimp, Honey and Jerk Glazed Salmon, and a nice burger!
